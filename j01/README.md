## Heating Up: Usability of the PRO1 T755 Thermostat
**By Cole Hanna, November 15th, 2024**

### Introduction
Thermostats are a small but essential part of home comfort. The device in my apartment, a **PRO1 IAQ T755 Thermostat**, advertises itself as a _"7-day Hot/2 Cold Programmable Mountable Intuitive Thermostat."_ However, as I found out, "intuitive" isn't always what you'd expect.

## The Experience

### Goal
I want to adjust the thermostat and program the **weekday** schedule so the heating is active when my roommates and I are waking up in the morning.

### Steps

1. **Understanding the Layout**  
   The thermostat features 8 buttons:  
   - **4 side buttons** for navigating menus with one labled on the screen as "MENU"  
   - **1 labeled "FAN."**  
   - **1 labeled "SYSTEM."**  
   - **2 buttons** labled on the side with "+" and "-" to increase/decrease the temperature.
  
   The main screen displayed options for navigation. I decided to press "MENU" because it seemed like the logical next step.
   
   The screen then displays options aligned to the side buttons:  
   - **"Tech Set"**  
   - **"Set Time"**  
   - **"Set Sched"**  
   - **"Done"**

   The alignment of these options with their corresponding buttons was inconsistent, but the interface made sense because there were four options and four buttons. I pressed "Set Sched" to adjust the schedule.

2. **Navigating the Menu**  
   Selecting **"Set Sched"** starts the process. The interface shows:  
   - **Actions**: "Next", "Prev" and "Done"
   - **Days**: "MonTueWedThuFri," "Sat," and "Sun."  
   - **Times**: Adjusted in 15-minute intervals.  
   - **Temperature**: Adjustable in 1-degree increments for "Cool" or "Heat."  
   - **Day Parts**: "WAKE," "LEAVE," "RETURN," and "SLEEP."

   The **flashing highlight** on the time field indicated where my input was focused—a clear example of **feedback.** Feedback, in this context, reassures users that their input is being acknowledged and helps guide them through the interaction. I used the buttons for "+" to increment and "-" decrement the time in lengths of 15 minutes, respectively. Going past the half day, changes the day section from "AM" to "PM" and vice versa. Selecting "NEXT" changes the blinking visibility to the temperature to adjust it 1 degree at a time. You can also adjust the temperature from "Cool" to "Heat" depending on preference. Pressing "Next" again changes the bottom display section to different parts of the day from:

"WAKE" -> "LEAVE" -> "RETURN" -> "SLEEP" -> Repeat

3. **Scheduling Example**  
   - Set **WAKE** to **7:30 AM** at **70°F.**
   - Set **LEAVE** to **8:30 AM** at **70°F.**

[![Here's a Video of the Process](./images/video-thumbnail.png)](https://youtube.com/shorts/lM2K6icLmAs?feature=share)

So I set my "WAKE" time for 7:30 AM and "LEAVE" time for 8:30AM at 70 degrees. The system is also smart enough to not allow scheduling for the same time, say "WAKE" and "LEAVE" being set to 10:00 AM and instead remains 15 minutes away. Changing between the times is also very slow, seen by my rapid clicking, since you have to press the button every time you want to cycle. After a section of the 3 days options is cycled through, it goes on to the next day's section. Next being "Sat" then "Sun" and then re-cycled back to "MonTueWedThuFri" back at its original setting state. If I wanted to go back at any point, I could press the "Prev" button to go back a section at any time. 

4. **Saving and Testing**  
   - Set **WAKE** to **7:30 AM** at **70°F.**
   - Set **LEAVE** to **8:30 AM** at **70°F.**

I finally pressed "Done" to save my choices into the system.

When morning came, the system started running correctly but when trying to adjust the settings using the "SYSTEM" button from "Heat" to "Off", it lacked feedback signifying that the system was turned off and didnt seem to turn off for at least 10 minutes afterwards.

## Conclusion

During this process, I discovered a mix of intuitive features as well as some flaws.
Strengths:
Un-used buttons were un-usable
Not being able to schedule a time at the same time
Simple and intuitive design
Website displayed manual if one was missing

Weaknesses:
User timeout was a bit too fast
Screen text doesn't line up with side buttons
Viewability for when the screen times out is too dark
Holding a button wouldn't rapidly cycle options
Nothing showing that a button was able to be pressed with lights or icons
Without a manual can be a process
