## Heating Up: Usability of the PRO1 T755 Thermostat
#### By Cole Hanna, November 15th, 2024

### Introduction
Thermostats are an essential part of home comfort, but not all are designed with the average user experience. My apartment came with a PRO1 IAQ T755 Thermostat which is advertized itself as a "7 day Hot/2 Cold Programable Mountable Intuative Thermostat" under the PRO1 brand 700's series.

## The Experience
### Goal
My aim is to program the thermostat to follow a weekday and weekend schedule for heating at time where I and my roomates are most likley home.

### Steps I took:
Approaching the thermostat, I see 8 buttons total: 4 on the side with on labeled "MENU" on the screen, 1 labled "FAN", 1 labled "SYSTEM" and 2 button for increasing and decreasing temperature. I press the MENU button because it seems like the correct path, I am meet with the descriptions on the side of the screen as: "Tech Set", "Set Time", "Set Sched", and finally "Done". They are all not correctly leveled next to their button but at least 4 options next to 4 buttons makes sense.
I am looking to set a Schedule so I press "Set Sched" and am brought to this screen presenting "Next", "Prev", and 'Done'. The day of the week is presented along side the time, day, and temperature.
Times: 
- Hour : Minutes
- AM / PM
Days: 
- "MonTueWedThuFri"
- "Sat"
- "Sun"
Temperature:
- "Set at"
- Temperature in degrees

The time section is flashing showing that its the portion thats been selected. Using "+" and "-" increments and decrements the time in lengths of 15 minutes, respectivly. Going past the half day, changes the day section from "AM" to "PM" and visa versa. Selecting "NEXT" changes the blinking to the temperature to adjust it 1 degree at a time. You can also adust the temperature from "Cool" to "Heat" depending on perference. Pressing "NEXT" again changes the bottom display section to different parts of the day from:
- "WAKE"
- "LEAVE"
- "RETURN"
- "SLEEP"

After a section of one of the 3 days options is cycled through, it goes on to the next days section. Next being "Sat" then "Sun" and then re-cycled back to "MonTueWedThuFri" back at its origional setting state. If I wanted to go back at any point, I could press the "Prev" button to go back a section at any time. I finally pressed "Done" to probably save my choices into the system.

## Conclusion

Durring this process, I discovered a mix of intuative features as well as some flaws.
User timeout was a bit too fast
Screen text doesnt line up with side buttons
Viewability for when the screen times out is too dark
